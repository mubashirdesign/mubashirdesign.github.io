Unfortunately there seems to be a large misconception that building sites are fast and cheap so they come to you expecting a $200-$300 website done for them.</p>\n<p>The easy way out is just to say no but then that cuts off possible opportunities that may arise from these friends/family (especially if they are well established in their career). So how do you go about capitilizing on these requests?</p>\n<p>Well let's just say your baseline rate for a static site is $300 because realistically once you go higher they'll run away which means you'll need to spend as little time and resources to make that $300 worth it.</p>\n<p>The usual go-to is to throw up a wordpress CMS, install a theme and have the client drop the content in it, unfortunately this has never worked out for me and the main reason is change requests such as \"can you move this here and change this color there?\" can be insanely tedious with wordpress themes that end up breaking everything. And honestly the people you deal with have no idea how to manage website content so you'll end up taking on handling the content on the site nulifying the purpose of a CMS. Once you've past the two hour mark fixing a small color issue then the project just isn't worth it anymore at that point.</p>","frontmatter":{"type":"blog","title":"Dealing with website requests from small-timers","path":"/1"}}}]}}}
