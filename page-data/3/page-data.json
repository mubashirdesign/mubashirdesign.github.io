With DevOps features built in natively, implementing automation, optimization, development and much more becomes almost dare I say easy.</p>\n<p><strong>So why is it not as widely adopted as wordpress or other CMS systems</strong>?</p>\n<p>Well there is no one solution that works for everyone, similar to how an exotic car wouldn't work well as a daily driver even though it could be superior in every manner.</p>\n<p><strong>Then the question is when would JAMStack be more effective than a CMS system?</strong></p>\n<p>Let's first pre-face this with the fact that this is mainly to the benefit of the in-house developer (you), as a solution for companies without an in-house dev this solution is definitely not as viable.</p>\n<p>Next you'll need to assess the current process of content management in your company, and then evaluate what performance actually means to the business.</p>\n<p>If your company has a content management team, uploading and managing content becomes the priority as the process has to be as easy as possible for them so scrapping the CMS system is not an option. There is however a work around, instead of building the static pages through markdown content, you could build the templates through querying the CMS API to pull all the inputted content by the content management team such as posts and blogs. This gives them the ease of uploading the content and you the developer the flexibilty to develop quickly and easily. This is generally when your CMS becomes headless as it isn't generating any pages but just providing data through the API. The key difference here is that the JAMStack site generates the content received from the CMS API into static files making it possible to distribute on a CDN making it unbeatable in terms of performance.</p>\n<p>Which leads us into the next part, what does performance actually mean to your company? This is where you'd determine if it's worth it to pitch JAMStack.</p>\n<p>To be continued....</p>","frontmatter":{"path":"/3","title":"Making the business case for JAMStack","excerpt":"Replacing the traditional CMS at the workplace","date":"2020-01-12"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false}}}
